    bibliography: "Athanasia Amanda Septevani is a Research Professor at the Research Centre for Electronics, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), Indonesia, where she leads the Sustainable Intelligent Electronics Systems Group. She earned her Ph.D. from the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at The University of Queensland, Australia, and a Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering from Universitas Diponegoro, Indonesia.\n\nHer research sits at the intersection of polymers, nanotechnology, and sustainable electronics, with a strong commitment to both fundamental and translational science. She is passionate about harnessing Indonesia's abundant biomass wastes to develop innovative processes that transform this resource into high-value biobased polymers, such as nanocellulose, a versatile material with wide-ranging applications in wearable and flexible electronics devices, energy systems, as well as medical devices. Beyond materials innovation, her group pioneers the integration of these green materials into flexible sensing systems, soft robotics, and IoT-enabled electronic platforms that advance sustainable technology.\n\nAmanda's contributions to STEM have been recognized globally. She is a recipient of the L'Or√©al‚ÄìUNESCO For Women in Science Award (2018), the Japan International Award for Young Agricultural Researchers (2022), and was named a Finalist in the Mid-career Category of the 2024 UL Research Institutes‚ÄìASEAN‚ÄìU.S. Science Prize for Women. In 2023, she was also featured in Asian Scientist as one of the Powerhouse Women Engineers of Our Time. Through international collaborations across Southeast Asia, America, and Europe, she continues to expand the development of sustainable, intelligent materials and systems that bridge science and societal impact."
