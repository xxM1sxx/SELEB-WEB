    bibliography: "Athanasia Amanda Septevani is a Research Professor at the Research Centre for Electronics, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), Indonesia, where she leads the Sustainable Intelligent Electronics Systems Group. She earned her Ph.D. from the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at The University of Queensland, Australia, and a Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering from Universitas Diponegoro, Indonesia.\n\nHer research sits at the intersection of polymers, nanotechnology, and sustainable electronics, with a strong commitment to both fundamental and translational science. She is passionate about harnessing Indonesia's abundant biomass wastes to develop innovative processes that transform this resource into high-value biobased polymers, such as nanocellulose, a versatile material with wide-ranging applications in wearable and flexible electronics devices, energy systems, as well as medical devices. Beyond materials innovation, her group pioneers the integration of these green materials into flexible sensing systems, soft robotics, and IoT-enabled electronic platforms that advance sustainable technology.\n\nAmanda's contributions to STEM have been recognized globally. She is a recipient of the L'Or√©al‚ÄìUNESCO For Women in Science Award (2018), the Japan International Award for Young Agricultural Researchers (2022), and was named a Finalist in the Mid-career Category of the 2024 UL Research Institutes‚ÄìASEAN‚ÄìU.S. Science Prize for Women. In 2023, she was also featured in Asian Scientist as one of the Powerhouse Women Engineers of Our Time. Through international collaborations across Southeast Asia, America, and Europe, she continues to expand the development of sustainable, intelligent materials and systems that bridge science and societal impact."

    bibliography: "I am part of the Sustainable Intelligent Electronics research group at the Research Center for Electronics, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), where I explore innovative and sustainable sensing technologies for environmental applications. My research integrates electrochemical, spectrochemical, and fluorescence principles to design smart and reliable sensors capable of detecting a wide range of contaminants, from heavy metal ions, organic pollutants to pesticide residues. A growing part of my work focuses on green synthesis and waste valorization, utilizing agro-waste and natural extracts to develop environmentally friendly sensor materials that support sustainable electronics.\n\nBeyond sensor development, I have a strong background in metrology in chemistry and quality infrastructure, ensuring that measurement and analytical practices meet the highest international standards. I also contribute as a laboratory assessor for ISO/IEC 17025 testing laboratories, ISO 17043 proficiency testing providers, and ISO 17034 reference material producers.\n\nDriven by strong interest for accuracy and sustainability, I am dedicated to creating smart, portable, and eco-friendly sensing systems that advance environmental monitoring and public health protection."
